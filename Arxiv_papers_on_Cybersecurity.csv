While existing literature proposes effective IIDS solutions evaluated in controlled environments, their deployment in real-world industrial settings poses several challenges. This paper highlights two critical yet often overlooked aspects that significantly impact their practical deployment, i.e., the need for sufficient amounts of data to train the IIDS models and the challenges associated with finding suitable hyperparameters, especially for IIDSs training only on genuine ICS data. Through empirical experiments conducted on multiple state-of-the-art IIDSs and diverse datasets, we establish the criticality of these issues in deploying IIDSs. Our findings show the necessity of extensive malicious training data for supervised IIDSs, which can be impractical considering the complexity of recording and labeling attacks in actual industrial environments. Furthermore, while other IIDSs circumvent the previous issue by requiring only benign training data, these can suffer from the difficulty of setting appropriate hyperparameters, which likewise can diminish their performance. By shedding light on these challenges, we aim to enhance the understanding of the limitations and considerations necessary for deploying effective cybersecurity solutions in ICSs, which might be one reason why IIDSs see few deployments.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 07:58:03 UTC (1,140 KB)"

In response to the challenges posed by the constantly evolving nature of cyber threats, the proposed approach aims to generate diverse and realistic synthetic attack scenarios, thereby enriching the dataset and improving threat identification. Integrating attention mechanisms with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) is a key feature of the proposed method. The attention mechanism enhances the model's ability to focus on relevant features, essential for detecting subtle and complex attack patterns. In addition, GANs address the issue of data scarcity by generating additional varied attack data, encompassing known and emerging threats. This dual approach ensures that the system remains relevant and effective against the continuously evolving cyberattacks. The KDD Cup and CICIDS2017 datasets were used to validate this model, which exhibited significant improvements in anomaly detection. It achieved an accuracy of 99.69% on the KDD dataset and 97.93% on the CICIDS2017 dataset, with precision, recall, and F1-scores above 97%, demonstrating its effectiveness in recognizing complex attack patterns. This study contributes significantly to cybersecurity by providing a scalable and adaptable solution for anomaly detection in the face of sophisticated and dynamic cyber threats.

Nonetheless, the prevalence of spam emails poses a significant challenge for users, disrupting their daily routines and diminishing productivity. Consequently, accurately identifying and filtering spam based on content has become crucial for cybersecurity. Recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly with large language models like ChatGPT, have shown remarkable performance in tasks such as question answering and text generation. However, its potential in spam identification remains underexplored. To fill in the gap, this study attempts to evaluate ChatGPT's capabilities for spam identification in both English and Chinese email datasets. We employ ChatGPT for spam email detection using in-context learning, which requires a prompt instruction and a few demonstrations. We also investigate how the training example size affects the performance of ChatGPT. For comparison, we also implement five popular benchmark methods, including naive Bayes, support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression (LR), feedforward dense neural networks (DNN), and BERT classifiers. Though extensive experiments, the performance of ChatGPT is significantly worse than deep supervised learning methods in the large English dataset, while it presents superior performance on the low-resourced Chinese dataset, even outperforming BERT in this case.","Fri, 23 Feb 2024 04:52:08 UTC (1,087 KB)"

However, SOME/IP lacks a robust security architecture, making it susceptible to potential attacks. Besides, random hardware failure of ECU will disrupt SOME/IP communication. In this paper, we propose SISSA, a SOME/IP communication traffic-based approach for modeling and analyzing in-vehicle functional safety and cyber security. Specifically, SISSA models hardware failures with the Weibull distribution and addresses five potential attacks on SOME/IP communication, including Distributed Denial-of-Services, Man-in-the-Middle, and abnormal communication processes, assuming a malicious user accesses the in-vehicle network. Subsequently, SISSA designs a series of deep learning models with various backbones to extract features from SOME/IP sessions among ECUs. We adopt residual self-attention to accelerate the model's convergence and enhance detection accuracy, determining whether an ECU is under attack, facing functional failure, or operating normally. Additionally, we have created and annotated a dataset encompassing various classes, including indicators of attack, functionality, and normalcy. This contribution is noteworthy due to the scarcity of publicly accessible datasets with such characteristics.Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness and efficiency of SISSA.","Wed, 21 Feb 2024 03:31:40 UTC (3,653 KB)"

TH is mandated for federal executive agencies and government contractors. As threat hunting is a new cybersecurity discipline, most TH teams operate without a defined process. The practices and challenges of TH have not yet been documented. To address this gap, this paper describes the first interview study of threat hunt practitioners. We obtained access and interviewed 11 threat hunters associated with the U.S. government's Department of Homeland Security. Hour-long interviews were conducted. We analyzed the transcripts with process and thematic coding.We describe the diversity among their processes, show that their processes differ from the TH processes reported in the literature, and unify our subjects' descriptions into a single TH process.We enumerate common TH challenges and solutions according to the subjects. The two most common challenges were difficulty in assessing a Threat Hunter's expertise, and developing and maintaining automation.

In recent past, we have also observed a rapid advancement of conversational generative AI chatbot services (e.g., OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's BARD), which are powered by pre-trained large language models (LLMs). These AI chatbots certainly have a lot of utilities but it is not systematically understood how they can play a role in creating threats and attacks. In this paper, we propose AbuseGPT method to show how the existing generative AI-based chatbot services can be exploited by attackers in real world to create smishing texts and eventually lead to craftier smishing campaigns. To the best of our knowledge, there is no pre-existing work that evidently shows the impacts of these generative text-based models on creating SMS phishing.

We have found strong empirical evidences to show that attackers can exploit ethical standards in the existing generative AI-based chatbot services by crafting prompt injection attacks to create newer smishing campaigns. We also discuss some future research directions and guidelines to protect the abuse of generative AI-based services and safeguard users from smishing attacks.","Thu, 15 Feb 2024 05:49:22 UTC (6,539 KB)"

CYDEC consists of deceiving the enemy who performs actions without realising that he/she is being deceived. This article proposes designing, implementing, and evaluating a deception mechanism based on the stealthy redirection of TCP communications to an on-demand honey server with the same characteristics as the victim asset, i.e., it is a clone. Such a mechanism ensures that the defender fools the attacker, thanks to stealth redirection. In this situation, the attacker will focus on attacking the honey server while enabling the recollection of relevant information to generate threat intelligence. The experiments in different scenarios show how the proposed solution can effectively redirect an attacker to a copied asset on demand, thus protecting the real asset. Finally, the results obtained by evaluating the latency times ensure that the redirection is undetectable by humans and very difficult to detect by a machine.","Wed, 14 Feb 2024 14:15:21 UTC (3,548 KB)[v2] Tue, 20 Feb 2024 11:26:52 UTC (3,641 KB)"

One of the most effective approaches for this purpose is to analyze network traffic with the help of artificial intelligence algorithms, with the aim of detecting the possible presence of an attacker by distinguishing it from a legitimate user. This is commonly done by collecting the traffic exchanged between terminals in a network and analyzing it on a per-packet or per-connection basis. In this paper, we propose instead to perform pre-processing of network traffic under analysis with the aim of extracting some new metrics on which we can perform more efficient detection and overcome some limitations of classical approaches. These new metrics are based on graph theory, and consider the network as a whole, rather than focusing on individual packets or connections. Our approach is validated through experiments performed on publicly available data sets, from which it results that it can not only overcome some of the limitations of classical approaches, but also achieve a better detection capability of cyber threats.","Mon, 12 Feb 2024 18:44:02 UTC (89 KB)"

Those implemented models have brought several vulnerabilities associated with Deep Learning technology. Moreover, those allow taking advantage of the implemented model, obtaining private information, and even modifying the model's decision-making. Therefore, interest in studying those vulnerabilities/attacks and designing defenses to avoid or fight them is gaining prominence among researchers. In particular, the widely known evasion attack is being analyzed by researchers; thus, several defenses to avoid such a threat can be found in the literature. Since the presentation of the L-BFG algorithm, this threat concerns the research community. However, it continues developing new and ingenious countermeasures since there is no perfect defense for all the known evasion algorithms. In this work, a novel detector of evasion attacks is developed. It focuses on the information of the activations of the neurons given by the model when an input sample is injected. Moreover, it puts attention to the topology of the targeted deep learning model to analyze the activations according to which neurons are connecting. This approach has been decided because the literature shows that the targeted model's topology contains essential information about if the evasion attack occurs. For this purpose, a huge data preprocessing is required to introduce all this information in the detector, which uses the Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN) technology. Thus, it understands the topology of the target model, obtaining promising results and improving the outcomes presented in the literature related to similar defenses.","Mon, 12 Feb 2024 08:39:40 UTC (1,252 KB)[v2] Tue, 13 Feb 2024 09:09:41 UTC (1,252 KB)"

Notably, algorithmic flaws in Machine Learning (ML) models present distinct challenges compared to traditional software vulnerabilities, warranting a specialized approach. To address this gap, we propose the implementation of a dedicated Coordinated Flaw Disclosure (CFD) framework tailored to the intricacies of machine learning and artificial intelligence issues. This paper delves into the historical landscape of disclosures in ML, encompassing the ad hoc reporting of harms and the emergence of participatory auditing.

In this paper, we conduct a thorough system-level investigation of cyber threats, with a specific focus on machine learning (ML) intelligence components known as xApps within the O-RAN's near-real-time RAN Intelligent Controller (near-RT RIC) platform. Our study begins by developing a malicious xApp designed to execute adversarial attacks on two types of test data - spectrograms and key performance metrics (KPMs), stored in the RIC database within the near-RT RIC. To mitigate these threats, we utilize a distillation technique that involves training a teacher model at a high softmax temperature and transferring its knowledge to a student model trained at a lower softmax temperature, which is deployed as the robust ML model within xApp. We prototype an over-the-air LTE/5G O-RAN testbed to assess the impact of these attacks and the effectiveness of the distillation defense technique by leveraging an ML-based Interference Classification (InterClass) xApp as an example. We examine two versions of InterClass xApp under distinct scenarios, one based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and another based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) using spectrograms and KPMs as input data respectively. Our findings reveal up to 100% and 96.3% degradation in the accuracy of both the CNN and DNN models respectively resulting in a significant decline in network performance under considered adversarial attacks.

This study examines Rhysida ransomware, which caused significant damage in the second half of 2023, and proposes a decryption method. Rhysida ransomware employed a secure random number generator to generate the encryption key and subsequently encrypt the data. However, an implementation vulnerability existed that enabled us to regenerate the internal state of the random number generator at the time of infection.

In this context, listed firms' reactions to cyber incidents are compelling to study since they (i) are a good proxy to estimate the costs borne by other organizations, (ii) have a critical position in the economy, and (iii) have their financial information publicly available. We extract listed firms' cyber incident dates and characteristics from newswire headlines. We use an event study over 2012--2022, using a three-day window around events and standard benchmarks. We find that the magnitude of abnormal returns around cyber incidents is on par with previous studies using newswire or alternative data to identify cyber incidents. Conversely, as we adjust the standard errors accounting for event-induced variance and residual cross-correlation, we find that the previously claimed significance of abnormal returns vanishes. Given these results, we run a horse race of specifications, in which we test for the marginal effects of type of cyber incidents, target firm sector, periods, and their interactions. Data breaches are the most detrimental incident type with an average loss of -1.3\% or (USD -1.9 billion) over the last decade. The health sector is the most sensitive to cyber incidents, with an average loss of -5.21\% (or USD -1.2 billion), and even more so when these are data breaches.

We observe firms, their primary and secondary activities, funding rounds, and pre and post-money valuations. We compare cybersecurity sectors regarding the amount raised over funding rounds and post-money valuations while inferring missing observations.

Analyzing and understanding network traffic is vital for improving network security and management. However, the analysis of network traffic is challenging due to the diverse nature of data packets, which often feature heterogeneous headers and encrypted payloads lacking semantics. To capture the latent semantics of traffic, a few studies have adopted pre-training techniques based on the Transformer encoder or decoder to learn the representations from massive traffic data. However, these methods typically excel in traffic understanding (classification) or traffic generation tasks. To address this issue, we develop Lens, a foundation model for network traffic that leverages the T5 architecture to learn the pre-trained representations from large-scale unlabeled data. Harnessing the strength of the encoder-decoder framework, which captures the global information while preserving the generative ability, our model can better learn the representations from raw data. To further enhance pre-training effectiveness, we design a novel loss that combines three distinct tasks: Masked Span Prediction (MSP), Packet Order Prediction (POP), and Homologous Traffic Prediction (HTP). Evaluation results across various benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed Lens outperforms the baselines in most downstream tasks related to both traffic understanding and generation.

Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models provide an efficient and accurate solution for identifying attacks and anomalies in computer networks. However, using ML and DL models in IDS has led to a trust deficit due to their non-transparent decision-making. This transparency gap in IDS research is significant, affecting confidence and accountability. To address, this paper introduces a novel Explainable IDS approach, called X-CBA, that leverages the structural advantages of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to effectively process network traffic data, while also adapting a new Explainable AI (XAI) methodology. Unlike most GNN-based IDS that depend on labeled network traffic and node features, thereby overlooking critical packet-level information, our approach leverages a broader range of traffic data through network flows, including edge attributes, to improve detection capabilities and adapt to novel threats. Through empirical testing, we establish that our approach not only achieves high accuracy with 99.47% in threat detection but also advances the field by providing clear, actionable explanations of its analytical outcomes. This research also aims to bridge the current gap and facilitate the broader integration of ML/DL technologies in cybersecurity defenses by offering a local and global explainability solution that is both precise and interpretable.","Thu, 1 Feb 2024 18:29:16 UTC (677 KB)"

However, these technological strides have also brought new challenges, particularly in terms of cybersecurity. IoT devices are inherently connected to the internet, which makes them more vulnerable to attack. In addition, IoT services often handle sensitive user data, which could be misused by malicious actors or unauthorized service providers. As more mainstream service providers emerge without uniform regulations, these security risks are expected to escalate exponentially. The task of maintaining the security of IoT devices while they interact with cloud services is also challenging. Newer IoT services, especially those developed and deployed via Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) models, pose additional security threats. Although IoT devices are becoming more affordable and ubiquitous, their growing complexity could expose users to heightened security and privacy risks. This paper highlights these pressing security concerns associated with the widespread adoption of IoT devices and services. We propose potential solutions to bridge the existing security gaps and expect future challenges. Our approach entails a comprehensive exploration of the key security challenges that IoT services are currently facing. We also suggest proactive strategies to mitigate these risks, strengthening the overall security of IoT devices and services.","Thu, 1 Feb 2024 05:55:43 UTC (484 KB)"

In this study, we address the prevalent issue of data integrity in network traffic datasets, which are instrumental in developing machine learning (ML) models for anomaly detection. We introduce two refined versions of the CICIDS-2017 dataset, NFS-2023-nTE and NFS-2023-TE, processed using NFStream to ensure methodologically sound flow expiration and labeling. Our research contrasts the performance of the Random Forest (RF) algorithm across the original CICIDS-2017, its refined counterparts WTMC-2021 and CRiSIS-2022, and our NFStream-generated datasets, in both binary and multi-class classification contexts. We observe that the RF model exhibits exceptional robustness, achieving consistent high-performance metrics irrespective of the underlying dataset quality, which prompts a critical discussion on the actual impact of data integrity on ML efficacy.

Gambetta","Quantum Physics (quant-ph)","Quantum computing is an emerging technology with potentially far-reaching implications for national prosperity and security. Understanding the timeframes over which economic benefits and national security risks may manifest themselves is vital for ensuring the prudent development of this technology. To inform security experts and policy decision makers on this matter, we review what is currently known on the potential uses and risks of quantum computers, leveraging current research literature. The maturity of currently-available quantum computers is not yet at a level such that they can be used in production for large-scale, industrially-relevant problems, and they are not believed to currently pose security risks. We identify 2 large-scale trends -- new approximate methods (variational algorithms, error mitigation, and circuit knitting) and the commercial exploration of business-relevant quantum applications -- which, together, may enable useful and practical quantum computing in the near future. Crucially, these methods do not appear likely to change the required resources for cryptanalysis on currently-used cryptosystems. From an analysis we perform of the current and known algorithms for cryptanalysis, we find they require circuits of a size exceeding those that can be run by current and near-future quantum computers (and which will require error correction), though we acknowledge improvements in quantum algorithms for these problems are taking place in the literature. In addition, the risk to cybersecurity can be well-managed by the migration to new, quantum-safe cryptographic protocols, which we survey and discuss. Given the above, we conclude there is a credible expectation that quantum computers will be capable of performing computations which are economically-impactful before they will be capable of performing ones which are cryptographically-relevant.","Mon, 29 Jan 2024 17:21:31 UTC (2,818 KB)[v2] Tue, 13 Feb 2024 18:47:44 UTC (2,410 KB)"

Lipton, Hoda Heidari","Computers and Society (cs.CY)","In response to rising concerns surrounding the safety, security, and trustworthiness of Generative AI (GenAI) models, practitioners and regulators alike have pointed to AI red-teaming as a key component of their strategies for identifying and mitigating these risks. However, despite AI red-teaming's central role in policy discussions and corporate messaging, significant questions remain about what precisely it means, what role it can play in regulation, and how precisely it relates to conventional red-teaming practices as originally conceived in the field of cybersecurity. In this work, we identify recent cases of red-teaming activities in the AI industry and conduct an extensive survey of the relevant research literature to characterize the scope, structure, and criteria for AI red-teaming practices. Our analysis reveals that prior methods and practices of AI red-teaming diverge along several axes, including the purpose of the activity (which is often vague), the artifact under evaluation, the setting in which the activity is conducted (e.g., actors, resources, and methods), and the resulting decisions it informs (e.g., reporting, disclosure, and mitigation). In light of our findings, we argue that while red-teaming may be a valuable big-tent idea for characterizing a broad set of activities and attitudes aimed at improving the behavior of GenAI models, gestures towards red-teaming as a panacea for every possible risk verge on security theater. To move toward a more robust toolbox of evaluations for generative AI, we synthesize our recommendations into a question bank meant to guide and scaffold future AI red-teaming practices.","Mon, 29 Jan 2024 05:46:14 UTC (576 KB)"

In light of the growing significance of endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems, many cybersecurity providers have developed their own proprietary EDR solutions. It's crucial for users to assess the capabilities of these detection engines to make informed decisions about which products to choose. This is especially urgent given the market's size, which is expected to reach around 3.7 billion dollars by 2023 and is still expanding. MITRE is a leading organization in cyber threat analysis. In 2018, MITRE started to conduct annual APT emulations that cover major EDR vendors worldwide. Indicators include telemetry, detection and blocking capability, etc. Nevertheless, the evaluation results published by MITRE don't contain any further interpretations or suggestions. In this paper, we thoroughly analyzed MITRE evaluation results to gain further insights into real-world EDR systems under test. Specifically, we designed a whole-graph analysis method, which utilizes additional control flow and data flow information to measure the performance of EDR systems. Besides, we analyze MITRE evaluation's results over multiple years from various aspects, including detection coverage, detection confidence, detection modifier, data source, compatibility, etc. Through the above studies, we have compiled a thorough summary of our findings and gained valuable insights from the evaluation results. We believe these summaries and insights can assist researchers, practitioners, and vendors in better understanding the strengths and limitations of mainstream EDR products.","Mon, 29 Jan 2024 04:19:56 UTC (4,347 KB)"

These perturbations could serve as perfectly non-invasive guidestars for focusing on the targets. In this Letter, we theoretically derive a fundamental difference between these two perturbation types (the change of the scattering matrix is of rank one [two] for target polarizability changes [motion]) and identify accordingly optimal strategies to perfectly focus on the target in both cases. For target motion, at least two displacements are necessary. Furthermore, for the case of dynamic complex media additionally featuring parasitic perturbers, we establish a non-invasive scheme to achieve optimal time-averaged power delivery to a perturbation-inducing target. In all cases, no assumptions about the unitarity of the system's scattering matrix or the size of the perturbation are necessary. We experimentally demonstrate all results in the microwave regime using a strongly sub-unitary lossy chaotic cavity as complex medium. Our experiments highlight that the target's ""structural scattering"" is irrelevant [must be negligible] in the case of target polarizability changes [motion]. We expect our results to find applications in communications, cybersecurity, bioelectronics, flow-cytometry and self-propelled nano-swimmers.","Sat, 27 Jan 2024 14:07:58 UTC (28,142 KB)"

Cybersecurity knowledge is limited and fragmented in this domain, while distributed ledger technology usage grows daily. Thus, research focusing on overcoming potential attacks on distributed ledgers is required. This study aims to raise awareness of the cybersecurity of distributed ledger technology by designing a security risk assessment method for distributed ledger technology applications. We have developed a database with possible security threats and known attacks on distributed ledger technologies to accompany the method, including sets of countermeasures. We employed a semi-systematic literature review combined with method engineering to develop a method that organizations can use to assess their cybersecurity risk for distributed ledger applications.

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a critical role in protecting interconnected networks by detecting malicious actors and activities. Machine Learning (ML)-based behavior analysis within the IDS has considerable potential for detecting dynamic cyber threats, identifying abnormalities, and identifying malicious conduct within the network. However, as the number of data grows, dimension reduction becomes an increasingly difficult task when training ML models. Addressing this, our paper introduces a novel ML-based network intrusion detection model that uses Random Oversampling (RO) to address data imbalance and Stacking Feature Embedding based on clustering results, as well as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimension reduction and is specifically designed for large and imbalanced datasets. This model's performance is carefully evaluated using three cutting-edge benchmark datasets: UNSW-NB15, CIC-IDS-2017, and CIC-IDS-2018.

Product liability, a powerful legal framework in other industries, has been largely ineffective for software products until recent times. However, the rapid regulatory responses to recent global cyberattacks by both the United States and the European Union, together with the (relative) success of the General Data Protection Regulation in defining both duty and standard of care for software vendors, may just enable regulators to use liability to re-align incentives for the benefit of the digital society. Specifically, the recently proposed United States National Cybersecurity Strategy shifts responsibility for cyber incidents back to software vendors. In doing so, the strategy also puts forward the concept of the liability waiver: if a software company voluntarily undergoes and passes an IT security audit, its liability is waived. In this paper, we analyze this audit scenario from the aspect of the software vendor. We propose a mechanism where a software vendor should first undergo a repeated auditing process in each stage of which the vendor decides whether to quit early or stay with additional security investment. We show that the optimal strategy for an opt-in vendor is to never quit; and exert cumulative investments in either ""one-and-done"" or ""incremental"" manner. We relate the audit mechanism to a liability waiver insurance policy and revealed its effect on reshaping the vendor's risk perception.

In this paper, we first illustrate how cyberattacks on different devices can have radically different consequences on the robot's ability to complete its tasks and preserve its embodiment. We also claim that modern robots should have self-awareness for what it concerns such aspects, and formulate the different characteristics that robots should integrate for doing so. Then, we show that achieving these propositions requires that robots possess at least three properties that conceptually link devices and tasks.

However, the effectiveness of honeypots has not been systematically investigated, beyond the rule of thumb that their effectiveness depends on how they are deployed. In this paper, we initiate a systematic study on characterizing the cybersecurity effectiveness of a new paradigm of deploying honeypots: blending honeypot computers (or IP addresses) into production computers. This leads to the following Honeypot Deployment (HD) problem, How should the defender blend honeypot computers into production computers to maximize the utility in forcing attackers to expose their new attacks while minimizing the loss to the defender in terms of the digital assets stored in the compromised production computers?

As the first generation of AVs, adaptive cruise control (ACC) vehicles are vulnerable to cyberattacks. While recent effort has been made to understanding the impact of attacks on transportation systems, little work has been done to systematically model and characterize the malicious nature of candidate attacks. In this study, we develop a general framework for modeling and synthesizing two types of candidate attacks on ACC vehicles, namely direct attacks on vehicle control commands and false data injection attacks on sensor measurement, with explicit characterization of their adverse effects. Based on linear stability analysis of car-following dynamics, we derive a series of analytical conditions characterizing the malicious nature of potential attacks. This ensures a higher degree of realism in modeling attacks with adverse effects, as opposed to simply considering attacks as constants or random variables. Notably, the conditions derived provide an effective method for strategically synthesizing an array of candidate attacks on ACC vehicles. We conduct extensive simulation to examine the impacts of intelligently designed attacks on microscopic car-following dynamics and macroscopic traffic flow. Numerical results illustrate the mechanism of candidate attacks, offering useful insights into understanding the vulnerability of future transportation systems. The methodology developed allows for further study of the widespread impact of strategically designed attacks on traffic cybersecurity, and is expected to inspire the development of efficient attack detection techniques and advanced vehicle controls.","Fri, 12 Jan 2024 00:33:04 UTC (2,483 KB)"

This progress, however, has made them appealing targets for cybersecurity attacks. As the risk of cyber threats escalates with this advancement, the focus is shifting from solely preventing these attacks to also mitigating their impact. Current solutions rely on vehicle security operation centers, where attack information is analyzed before deciding on a response strategy. However, this process can be time-consuming and faces scalability challenges, along with other issues stemming from vehicle connectivity. This paper proposes a dynamic intrusion response system integrated within the vehicle. This system enables the vehicle to respond to a variety of incidents almost instantly, thereby reducing the need for interaction with the vehicle security operation center. The system offers a comprehensive list of potential responses, a methodology for response evaluation, and various response selection methods. The proposed solution was implemented on an embedded platform. Two distinct cyberattack use cases served as the basis for evaluating the system. The evaluation highlights the system's adaptability, its ability to respond swiftly, its minimal memory footprint, and its capacity for dynamic system parameter adjustments.

In these games, multiple players must allocate limited resources to overcome their opponent(s), while minimizing any induced individual losses. However, existing means of assessing the performance of resource allocation algorithms are highly disparate and problem-dependent. As a result, evaluating such algorithms is unreliable or impossible in many contexts and applications, especially when considering differing levels of feedback. To resolve this problem, we propose a generalized definition of payoff which uses an arbitrary user-provided function. This unifies performance evaluation under all contexts and levels of feedback. Using this definition, we develop metrics for evaluating player performance, and estimators to approximate them under uncertainty (i.e., bandit or semi-bandit feedback). These metrics and their respective estimators provide a problem-agnostic means to contextualize and evaluate algorithm performance. To validate the accuracy of our estimator, we explore the Colonel Blotto ($\mathcal{CB}$) game as an example. To this end, we propose a graph-pruning approach to efficiently identify feasible opponent decisions, which are used in computing our estimation metrics. Using various resource allocation algorithms and game parameters, a suite of $\mathcal{CB}$ games are simulated and used to compute and evaluate the quality of our estimates. These simulations empirically show our approach to be highly accurate at estimating the metrics associated with the unseen outcomes of an opponent's latent behavior.","Mon, 8 Jan 2024 22:31:57 UTC (56 KB)"

However, this made such environments vulnerable against cyber-attacks that can compromise their correct functioning resulting in economic or social problems. Lately, an increase of cyberattacks to industrial environments has been experienced. Moreover, implementing cryptosystems in the communications between OT devices is a more challenging task than for IT environments since the OT are generally composed of legacy elements, characterized by low-computational capabilities. Consequently, implementing cryptosystems in industrial communication networks faces a trade-off between the security of the communications and the amortization of the industrial infrastructure. Critical Infrastructure (CI) refers to the industries which provide key resources for the daily social and economical development, e.g. electricity or water, and their communications are a very exposed target to cyberattacks. Furthermore, a new threat to cybersecurity has arisen with the theoretical proposal of quantum computers, due to their potential ability of breaking state-of-the-art cryptography protocols, such as RSA or ECC. The chase of functional quantum computers has resulted in a technological race involving many global agents. Those agents have become aware that transitioning their secure communications to a quantum secure paradigm is a priority that should be established before the arrival of fault-tolerance. In this sense, two main cryptographic solutions have been proposed: QKD and PQC. Nevertheless, quantum secure solutions have been mainly centered from the perspective of IT environments. In this paper, we provide a perspective of the problem of applying PQC solutions to CI and analyze which could be the most suitable cryptography schemes for these scenarios.","Mon, 8 Jan 2024 10:02:48 UTC (652 KB)"

Cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) reports on past cyberattack incidents describe the chain of malicious actions with respect to time. To avoid repeating cyberattack incidents, practitioners must proactively identify and defend against recurring chain of actions - which we refer to as temporal attack patterns. Automatically mining the patterns among actions provides structured and actionable information on the adversary behavior of past cyberattacks. The goal of this paper is to aid security practitioners in prioritizing and proactive defense against cyberattacks by mining temporal attack patterns from cyberthreat intelligence reports. To this end, we propose ChronoCTI, an automated pipeline for mining temporal attack patterns from cyberthreat intelligence (CTI) reports of past cyberattacks. To construct ChronoCTI, we build the ground truth dataset of temporal attack patterns and apply state-of-the-art large language models, natural language processing, and machine learning techniques. We apply ChronoCTI on a set of 713 CTI reports, where we identify 124 temporal attack patterns - which we categorize into nine pattern categories. We identify that the most prevalent pattern category is to trick victim users into executing malicious code to initiate the attack, followed by bypassing the anti-malware system in the victim network. Based on the observed patterns, we advocate organizations to train users about cybersecurity best practices, introduce immutable operating systems with limited functionalities, and enforce multi-user authentications. Moreover, we advocate practitioners to leverage the automated mining capability of ChronoCTI and design countermeasures against the recurring attack patterns.","Wed, 3 Jan 2024 18:53:22 UTC (970 KB)"

Objective: The goal of this research is to inform cybersecurity practitioners about how adversaries form cyberattacks through an analysis of adversarial techniques documented in cyberthreat intelligence reports. Dataset: We use 594 adversarial techniques cataloged in MITRE ATT\&CK. We systematically construct a set of 667 CTI reports that MITRE ATT\&CK used as citations in the descriptions of the cataloged adversarial techniques. Methodology: We analyze the frequency and trend of adversarial techniques, followed by a qualitative analysis of the implementation of techniques. Next, we perform association rule mining to identify pairs of techniques recurring in APT attacks. We then perform qualitative analysis to identify the underlying relations among the techniques in the recurring pairs. Findings: The set of 667 CTI reports documents 10,370 techniques in total, and we identify 19 prevalent techniques accounting for 37.3\% of documented techniques. We also identify 425 statistically significant recurring pairs and seven types of relations among the techniques in these pairs. The top three among the seven relationships suggest that techniques used by the malware inter-relate with one another in terms of (a) abusing or affecting the same system assets, (b) executing in sequences, and (c) overlapping in their implementations. Overall, the study quantifies how adversaries leverage techniques through malware in APT attacks based on publicly reported documents.

However, existing taxonomies only focus on a narrow range of attacks and limited threat attributes, lacking a comprehensive characterization of manufacturing cybersecurity threats. There is little to no focus on characterizing threat actors and their intent, specific system and machine behavioral deviations introduced by cyberattacks, system-level and operational implications of attacks, and potential countermeasures against those attacks. To close this pressing research gap, this work proposes a comprehensive attack taxonomy for a holistic understanding and characterization of cybersecurity threats in manufacturing systems. Specifically, it introduces taxonomical classifications for threat actors and their intent and potential alterations in system behavior due to threat events. The proposed taxonomy categorizes attack methods/vectors and targets/locations and incorporates operational and system-level attack impacts. This paper also presents a classification structure for countermeasures, provides examples of potential countermeasures, and explains how they fit into the proposed taxonomical classification. Finally, the implementation of the proposed taxonomy is illustrated using two realistic scenarios of attacks on typical smart manufacturing systems, as well as several real-world cyber-physical attack incidents and academic case studies. The developed manufacturing attack taxonomy offers a holistic view of the attack chain in manufacturing systems, starting from the attack launch to the possible damages and system behavior changes within the system.

The interpretation of TTPs in the MITRE ATT&CK framework can be challenging for cybersecurity practitioners due to presumed expertise, complex dependencies, and inherent ambiguity. Meanwhile, advancements with Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to recent surge in studies exploring its uses in cybersecurity operations. This leads us to question how well encoder-only (e.g., RoBERTa) and decoder-only (e.g., GPT-3.5) LLMs can comprehend and summarize TTPs to inform analysts of the intended purposes (i.e., tactics) of a cyberattack procedure. The state-of-the-art LLMs have shown to be prone to hallucination by providing inaccurate information, which is problematic in critical domains like cybersecurity. Therefore, we propose the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to extract relevant contexts for each cyberattack procedure for decoder-only LLMs (without fine-tuning). We further contrast such approach against supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of encoder-only LLMs. Our results reveal that both the direct-use of decoder-only LLMs (i.e., its pre-trained knowledge) and the SFT of encoder-only LLMs offer inaccurate interpretation of cyberattack procedures. Significant improvements are shown when RAG is used for decoder-only LLMs, particularly when directly relevant context is found. This study further sheds insights on the limitations and capabilities of using RAG for LLMs in interpreting TTPs.","Sat, 30 Dec 2023 16:56:24 UTC (2,023 KB)[v2] Fri, 12 Jan 2024 16:37:02 UTC (2,023 KB)"

The goal of this research is to aid practitioners in making informed choices about the use of Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST) and Runtime Application Self-Protection (RASP) tools through an analysis of their effectiveness and efficiency in comparison with different vulnerability detection and prevention techniques and tools. We apply IAST and RASP on OpenMRS, an open-source Java-based online application. We compare the efficiency and effectiveness of IAST and RASP with techniques applied on OpenMRS in prior work. We measure efficiency and effectiveness in terms of the number and type of vulnerabilities detected and prevented per hour. Our study shows IAST performed relatively well compared to other techniques, performing second-best in both efficiency and effectiveness. IAST detected eight Top-10 OWASP security risks compared to nine by SMPT and seven for EMPT, DAST, and SAST. IAST found more vulnerabilities than SMPT. The efficiency of IAST (2.14 VpH) is second to only EMPT (2.22 VpH). These findings imply that our study benefited from using IAST when conducting black-box security testing. In the context of a large, enterprise-scale web application such as OpenMRS, RASP does not replace vulnerability detection, while IAST is a powerful tool that complements other techniques.","Fri, 29 Dec 2023 18:26:05 UTC (688 KB)"

Furthermore the model retraining times raise problems in time-sensitive and high-volume deployment systems where the retraining period directly impacts the models ability to respond to ongoing attacks in a timely manner. In this study we propose a temporal knowledge distillation-based label augmentation approach (TKD) which utilizes the learning from older models to rapidly boost the latest model and effectively reduces the model retraining times to achieve improved agility. Experimental results show that the proposed approach provides advantages in retraining times while improving the model performance.","Thu, 28 Dec 2023 03:04:30 UTC (250 KB)"

However, the cybersecurity concerns associated with LLMs have become increasingly prominent. Previous research has primarily focused on patching system vulnerabilities to enhance cybersecurity, but these approaches are not well-suited to the Metaverse, where the virtual space is more complex, LLMs are vulnerable, and ethical user interaction is critical. Moreover, the scope of cybersecurity in the Metaverse is expected to expand significantly. This paper proposes a method for enhancing cybersecurity through the simulation of user interaction with LLMs. Our goal is to educate users and strengthen their defense capabilities through exposure to a comprehensive simulation system. This system includes extensive Metaverse cybersecurity Q&A and attack simulation scenarios. By engaging with these, users will improve their ability to recognize and withstand risks. Additionally, to address the ethical implications of user input, we propose using LLMs as evaluators to assess user content across five dimensions. We further adapt the models through vocabulary expansion training to better understand personalized inputs and emoticons. We conduct experiments on multiple LLMs and find that our approach is effective.","Fri, 22 Dec 2023 07:15:55 UTC (396 KB)"

An attack graph depicting the propagation of potential cyber-attack sequences from the initial access point to the end objective is vital to identify critical weaknesses of any cyber-physical system. A cyber security personnel can accordingly plan preventive mitigation measures for the identified weaknesses addressing the cyber-attack sequences. However, limitations on available cybersecurity budget restrict the choice of mitigation measures. We address this aspect through our framework, which solves the following problem: given potential cyber-attack sequences for a cyber-physical component in the power grid, find the optimal manner to allocate an available budget to implement necessary preventive mitigation measures. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) to identify the optimal budget partition and set of mitigation measures which minimize the vulnerability of cyber-physical components to potential attack sequences. We assume that the allocation of budget affects the efficacy of the mitigation measures. We show how altering the budget allocation for tasks such as asset management, cybersecurity infrastructure improvement, incident response planning and employee training affects the choice of the optimal set of preventive mitigation measures and modifies the associated cybersecurity risk. The proposed framework can be used by cyber policymakers and system owners to allocate optimal budgets for various tasks required to improve the overall security of a cyber-physical system.","Wed, 20 Dec 2023 23:01:35 UTC (2,701 KB)"

However, collaboration is often hindered by concerns over privacy and business sensitivities. Federated learning addresses these issues by enabling multi-clients collaboration without direct data exchange. Unfortunately, if highly expressive Transformer models are used, clients may face intolerable computational burdens, and the exchange of weights could quickly deplete network bandwidth. In this paper, we propose Fed-urlBERT, a federated URL pre-trained model designed to address both privacy concerns and the need for cross-domain collaboration in cybersecurity. Fed-urlBERT leverages split learning to divide the pre-training model into client and server part, so that the client part takes up less extensive computation resources and bandwidth. Our appraoch achieves performance comparable to centralized model under both independently and identically distributed (IID) and two non-IID data scenarios. Significantly, our federated model shows about an 7% decrease in the FPR compared to the centralized model. Additionally, we implement an adaptive local aggregation strategy that mitigates heterogeneity among clients, demonstrating promising performance improvements.

To overcome the problem of modeling and solving within a limited time and balancing costs and benefits, we propose a low-cost, high-impact node injection attack via dynamic programming (DPNIA) framework. DPNIA models ASNA as a problem of maximizing the number of confirmed incorrect correspondent node pairs who have a greater similarity scores than the pairs between existing nodes, making ASNA solvable. Meanwhile, it employs a cross-network evaluation method to identify node vulnerability, facilitating a progressive attack from easy to difficult. Additionally, it utilizes an optimal injection strategy searching method, based on dynamic programming, to determine which links should be added between injected nodes and existing nodes, thereby achieving a high impact for attack effectiveness at a low cost.

In the meantime, LLMs have also gained traction in the security community, revealing security vulnerabilities and showcasing their potential in security-related tasks. This paper explores the intersection of LLMs with security and privacy. Specifically, we investigate how LLMs positively impact security and privacy, potential risks and threats associated with their use, and inherent vulnerabilities within LLMs. Through a comprehensive literature review, the paper categorizes the papers into ""The Good"" (beneficial LLM applications), ""The Bad"" (offensive applications), and ""The Ugly"" (vulnerabilities of LLMs and their defenses). We have some interesting findings. For example, LLMs have proven to enhance code security (code vulnerability detection) and data privacy (data confidentiality protection), outperforming traditional methods. However, they can also be harnessed for various attacks (particularly user-level attacks) due to their human-like reasoning abilities. We have identified areas that require further research efforts.

In addition, the IDS will be equipped with multiple datasets so that the accuracy of the models improves. We evaluate the performance of multiple ML models and their respective hyperparameter settings through various metrics to compare their results to other models and past research work. The results of the proposed multi-dataset integration method yielded an accuracy score of 99.9% when equipped with the XGBoost and random forest classifiers and RandomizedSearchCV hyperparameter technique.","Mon, 4 Dec 2023 14:58:19 UTC (446 KB)"

Recent papers have examined attacks targeting satellites and space systems; however, they did not comprehensively analyze the threats to satellites and systematically identify adversarial techniques across the attack lifecycle. This paper presents a comprehensive taxonomy of adversarial tactics, techniques, and procedures explicitly targeting LEO satellites. First, we analyze the space ecosystem including the ground, space, Communication, and user segments, highlighting their architectures, functions, and vulnerabilities. Then, we examine the threat landscape, including adversary types, and capabilities, and survey historical and recent attacks such as jamming, spoofing, and supply chain. Finally, we propose a novel extension of the MITRE ATT&CK framework to categorize satellite attack techniques across the adversary lifecycle from reconnaissance to impact. The taxonomy is demonstrated by modeling high-profile incidents, including the Viasat attack that disrupted Ukraine's communications. The taxonomy provides the foundation for the development of defenses against emerging cyber risks to space assets. The proposed threat model will advance research in the space domain and contribute to the security of the space domain against sophisticated attacks.","Sun, 3 Dec 2023 09:38:28 UTC (617 KB)"

Unfortunately, in cyberthreat detection, high-quality data is hard to come by. Moreover, for some specific applications of ML, such data must be labeled by human operators. Many works ""assume"" that labeling is tough/challenging/costly in cyberthreat detection, thereby proposing solutions to address such a hurdle. Yet, we found no work that specifically addresses the process of labeling 'from the viewpoint of ML security practitioners'. This is a problem: to this date, it is still mostly unknown how labeling is done in practice -- thereby preventing one from pinpointing ""what is needed"" in the real world. In this paper, we take the first step to build a bridge between academic research and security practice in the context of data labeling. First, we reach out to five subject matter experts and carry out open interviews to identify pain points in their labeling routines. Then, by using our findings as a scaffold, we conduct a user study with 13 practitioners from large security companies, and ask detailed questions on subjects such as active learning, costs of labeling, and revision of labels. Finally, we perform proof-of-concept experiments addressing labeling-related aspects in cyberthreat detection that are sometimes overlooked in research. Altogether, our contributions and recommendations serve as a stepping stone to future endeavors aimed at improving the quality and robustness of ML-driven security systems.

However, this transformation has also given rise to a significant cybersecurity challenge: the rapid proliferation of malicious URLs, which serve as entry points for a wide range of cyber threats. In this study, we present an efficient pre-training model-based framework for malicious URL detection. Leveraging the subword and character-aware pre-trained model, CharBERT, as our foundation, we further develop three key modules: hierarchical feature extraction, layer-aware attention, and spatial pyramid pooling. The hierarchical feature extraction module follows the pyramid feature learning principle, extracting multi-level URL embeddings from the different Transformer layers of CharBERT. Subsequently, the layer-aware attention module autonomously learns connections among features at various hierarchical levels and allocates varying weight coefficients to each level of features. Finally, the spatial pyramid pooling module performs multiscale downsampling on the weighted multi-level feature pyramid, achieving the capture of local features as well as the aggregation of global features. The proposed method has been extensively validated on multiple public datasets, demonstrating a significant improvement over prior works, with the maximum accuracy gap reaching 8.43% compared to the previous state-of-the-art method. Additionally, we have assessed the model's generalization and robustness in scenarios such as cross-dataset evaluation and adversarial attacks.

In order to address this gap, we leverage ongoing work on the Cyber Security Body of Knowledge (CyBOK) to help elicit and document the responsibilities and ethics of the profession. Based on a literature review of the ethics of cybersecurity, we use CyBOK to frame the exploration of ethical challenges in the cybersecurity profession through a series of 15 interviews with cybersecurity experts.

Our findings indicate that there are broad ethical challenges across the whole of cybersecurity, but also that different areas of cybersecurity can face specific ethical considerations for which more detailed guidance can help professionals in those areas. In particular, our findings indicate that security decision-making is expected of all security professionals, but that this requires them to balance a complex mix of technical, objective and subjective points of view, and that resolving conflicts raises challenging ethical dilemmas.

Additionally, as cyberattacks follow a multi-domain attack surface, a similar defensive approach should be applied, namely, the use of an evolving multi-disciplinary solution that combines ITS, cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence (AI). With the increased popularity of AI solutions, due to Big Data use-case scenarios and decision support and automation scenarios, new opportunities to apply Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have emerged, namely ITS empowerment. Using ML algorithms, an ITS can augment its intrusion tolerance capability, by learning from previous attacks and from known vulnerabilities. As such, this work's contribution is twofold: (1) an ITS architecture (Skynet) based on the state-of-the-art and incorporates new components to increase its intrusion tolerance capability and its adaptability to new adversaries; (2) an improved Risk Manager design that leverages AI to improve ITSs by automatically assessing OS risks to intrusions, and advise with safer configurations. One of the reasons that intrusions are successful is due to bad configurations or slow adaptability to new threats. This can be caused by the dependency that systems have for human intervention. One of the characteristics in Skynet and HAL 9000 design is the removal of human intervention. Being fully automatized lowers the chance of successful intrusions caused by human error. Our experiments using Skynet, shows that HAL is able to choose 15% safer configurations than the state-of-the-art risk manager.","Wed, 15 Nov 2023 23:36:14 UTC (2,097 KB)"
